# eLibrary 0.0.1
### EF eLibrary Web-application.
#### Purpose: self-service mobile library web-application
As of April 25th, 2018, I feel comfortable enough with the state of the application to put it on GitHub and treat it as more of a professional development. Thus, the GitHub repository and the readme. This will help me keep track of developments as they come, as well as direct people to projects and work done online.
##### Dependencies:
* [JsQrScanner](https://github.com/jbialobr/JsQRScanner "JavaScript QR Scanner for HTML5 Supporting Browsers")
